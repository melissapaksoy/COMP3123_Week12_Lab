# React Redux + JWT Demo

This is my small self-directed research project showing how React, Redux, and JWT (JSON Web Token) work together in a simple authentication flow.

The app includes:
- Login page
- Fake backend that returns a dummy JWT
- Redux store managing user state
- Protected dashboard visible only after login
- Logout functionality
- Basic demonstration of dispatch, actions, reducer, state & subscribe

## 🔍 Concepts I Researched

### Redux

**0 – State:**  
Global data stored in Redux (user, token, isAuthenticated).

**1 – Store:**  
The single place that holds all application state. Created with `configureStore()`.

**2 – Reducer:**  
Pure functions that update state based on actions. My main reducer is `authSlice`.

**3 – Action:**  
Objects that describe what happened (ex: `loginSuccess`). Auto-generated by Redux Toolkit.

**4 – Dispatch:**  
Function used to send actions to the store. Used when logging in or logging out.

**5 – Subscribe:**  
React uses `useSelector()` to subscribe automatically.  
(I also added a manual `store.subscribe()` in `store.js`.)

### JWT – JSON Web Token

- Used for authentication.
- After login, the server normally sends a JWT.
- The frontend attaches it to requests using:  
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- In this demo, I generate a **fake** JWT and store it in Redux + localStorage.

## 💻 How the App Works

1. User logs in with `admin / password`.
2. Fake API returns a user object + dummy JWT.
3. Redux stores the token and user info.
4. Dashboard becomes visible (protected content).
5. Logout clears the session.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal.

## ✨ Notes

This project is for learning/demo purposes only.  
The JWT in this example is fake — real authentication requires a backend to sign and verify tokens.
